## Problem

The current system work through notice board. The resident has to goto to the place where the notice board is placed. There can be more than one notices at a time. It is possible that notices are put without any sort of order. It can be a exhausting work for some residents to go through all notices and find the most relevant from their busy schedule.

A possible solution is to use messaging application like WhatsApp, Telegram, etc. However, the problem with this solution is that the single group will contain information about the meetings, annoucements, maintenance, etc. So residents has to go through all messages. With this soltution it is not possible to get reminder for meetings, or maintenance due, except reminding by posting a message.

## Proposed Solution

To over come the problem described above, there can be a computerized system which is specifically designed for this purpose; where residents can notified for new annoucements, reminded for upcoming meetings and due maintenance.
